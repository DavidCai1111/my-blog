有孩子后的一个好处是，当你给与他人建议时，你都会在内心问自己，“如果面对的是我的孩子，我会如何告诉他？”。我的孩子还小，但是我可以想象到当他在大学时，我会如何给与他有关创业的建议，并且这就是我准备告诉你们的。

创业是反直觉的。我不能明确说出是为什么。可能是因为有关创业的知识并没有在我们的文化中有很深的积淀与渗透。无论如何，创业是一件你不能总是相信自己直觉的事情。

在某些方面，它和滑雪很像。当你第一次滑雪时，你想要慢下来，然后你的直接是往后仰。但是如果你后仰，那么你就会失去对滑板的控制，然后掉下山坡。所以，学习滑雪的一部分任务就是克服这种冲动。经过刻意的训练后，你才会养成正确的新习惯。

创业和滑雪在某些方面都有些反自然。所以以下是我给你的一些初步建议。

## 反直觉

第一件时我已经提到了：创业是反直觉的，如果你一直相信你的直觉，你会犯一些错。好了，就算你仅知道这一点，至少在很多做决策情况下，你会先停下来想想。

当我在 Y Combinator 时，我经常开玩笑表示我们的任务是告诉创业者那些他们肯定将会忘记的事。这是真的，一波接着一波，YC 的合伙人告诉创业者他们即将会犯的错误，然后创业者忽视了他们，一年之后，他们跑回来说：“我真希望我当时记住了你们的提醒”。

为什么创业者总是遗忘 YC 合伙人的建议呢？因为这些建议都反直觉：它们挑战着你的直觉。它们看起来像是错误的建议。所以很自然你的第一反应就是忽视它们。反过来说，如果你的建议不是反直觉的，那么创业者的直觉已经给了他们答案。这也是为什么有那么多滑雪教练，而没有那么多跑步教练。

但是，你至少可以相信对人的直觉。事实上，年轻创业者最做不到的事情之一，便是这一点。他们与看起来另他们印象深刻的人合作，但是又犹犹豫豫。之后当出状况时，他们会说：“我就知道他们有问题，但是他们在某方面让我印象深刻，所以我忽略了”。

如果你想要与某人合作 - 作为合伙人，雇员，投资人或者收购人，并且你对他们有所疑虑，请相信你的直觉。如果他们看起来过于圆滑，假惺惺，或者像一个混蛋。请不要忽视它。

只有你和信得过的人合作，合作才可能会长久。

## 专业性

第二件反直觉的事情是：对于创业本身，了解特别多其实并不是很重要。创业成功并不是因为你是创业专家，而是因为你了解你的用户，以及你解决用户问题的方法。Mark Zuckerberg 创业时对创业一无所知，但是他非常了解用户，所以他成功了。

比如，如果你不知道如何获得一比天使投资，不要感到焦虑。这类事情可以在必要时学习，然后忘掉。

事实上，如果一个年轻人过于了解创业的方方面面，我反而会觉得这事很危险。如果我遇到一个本科生对于期权，员工协议和 FF 股票特别了解，这会拉响我心里的警报。我会想“他对于同龄人来说，在这方面知道的过于多了”。如果另一个典型的年轻创业者会犯的错误就是刻板的做创业表面上的事情。他们有一个听似合理的想法，得到一比客观的融资，租到一个很酷的办公室，雇佣了一帮员工。但是在他租下了很酷的办公室并招完人后，他可能会想：他们把事情弄得有多糟糕，因为他们忽视了一件本质的事情：去做那些用户想要的东西。

## 游戏心态

这种现象我们见得非常多，以至于我们为其取了个名称：游戏室。年轻人之所以去经历创业中那些事的原因是，他们一生中，接受的大多数训练都是为了得到一个目的性的结果。例如，考上大学。

我不是讽刺我们的教育系统。如果你被教育目的性如此强地去达到某个目的，那么其中会带着一些非初心的虚假。而其他人会发现它。

我很后悔我在大学时也是抱有这种心态。我发现在大多数课程中，只有 20 到 30 个知识点可能会被最后作为考试题目。所以我学习课程的方法并不是去理解那些知识的本质，而是去猜测潜在的能成为考题的知识点。当我进入考场时，我唯一在乎的就是我押题的准确率有多高。这就像是在玩一场游戏一样。

当一生都在被以这种方式训练时，年轻的创业者在第一次创业时，自然而然也会去寻求在创业这场游戏里，能快速成功的技巧与捷径。由于得到融资往往是衡量一个创业公司是否成功的指标（这是一个很典型的误解），他们常常去学习说服投资人的话术。我们告诉他们，说服投资人的最好的方式就是确保你的业务会快速成长，然后就这么简单地告诉投资人。在拿到融资后，他们便会去寻找高速增长的技巧，然后我们会告诉他们，最好的方式就是去做用户想要的产品。

有许许多多在 YC 合伙人和年轻创业者之间的对话以“我们该怎么...”开头，而以“其实只需要...”结尾。

为什么创始人总把事情搞得如此复杂？我理解的原因是，他们总是在寻求捷径。

所以这是第三件反直觉的事情：创业是一件游戏心态行不通的事情。游戏心态在打工时可能会有用，这取决于你的公司的制度有多糟糕。但这在创业时是行不通的。你没有可以欺骗的上司，你只有你的用户，而你的用户仅关心你的产品是否满足了他们的需求。创业和物理一样没有人情味，你只有做出了人们要的东西，你才会收获财富。

危险的事情是，如果你是一个伪装大师，你可能可以得到一轮，甚至两轮的融资。但这并不符合你的核心利益，公司最终会难以为继。而你的时间被浪费了。

所以不要再寻求技巧了。和任何领域一样，创业中存在技巧，但是它们的重要性很低，你需要去解决真正的问题。一个正真解决用户需求的创始人，终究会比仅懂的融资话术的创始人更轻松地得到融资。更重要的是，他的公司在之后也会更成功。

## 耗时耗力

第四件反直觉的事情是：创业非常耗时耗力。如果你创业了，它将花费的时间是非常大的。如果你的公司成功了，它将花费你几年或者几十年的时间，甚至是直至你退休。所以，这件事存在很大的机会成本。

Larry Page 似乎过着令人羡慕的生活，但是其中的一部分却让人并不那么羡慕。从 25 岁开始，他就尽可能以最快的节奏工作，并且之后就从未停下过。每天在谷歌，都有新的问题，作为 CEO ，他都不得不去处理。如果他度假一周，那么就会有一周的问题堆积下来。他必须承受这些，并且不能抱怨，因为作为公司的 CEO ，他不能表现出恐惧和需求，并且作为一个亿万富翁，社会并不会对他的状态有任何同情。这种现象的副作用就是，除了成功的创业者之外，没有其他人并不知道各中酸楚。

Y Combinator 如今投资了好几家可以被成为独角兽的公司，并且他们的创始人的情境都与如上所述没有区别。问题从来不会减少，只会增加。

当谈到创业时，许多人似乎认为他们命中注定要创业，并且在大学时就该开始。你们疯了吗？那些大学在想什么？它们为学生准备创业课程，并且建立孵化基地。

不过话说回来，大学这么做也是迫不得已的。越来越多的大学生会创业感兴趣。而大学被大家期望去满足学生将来的职业需求。如果大学不这么做，它们就可能会流失生源。

那么大学能教会学生创业吗？很难说。它们可以教会学生创业公司的事，但正如我之前解释的，这不是学生们需要知道的。他们需要去了解用户需要的东西，但是在正在创业之前，这又是无法做到的。所以创业是一件需要通过实践来学习的事情。这在学校里是做不到的，正如我之前解释的：创业会占领你的生活，当你是个学生时，你不可能真正去创办一家公司，因为一旦你创办了公司，你就不再是学生了。

所以，你该如何抉择？真正创业还是继续做学生？我可以给你回答。不要在大学里创业。创业只是你要解决的人生问题中的一个子集：如何拥有一个美好的人生。创业就像一个异常快速的深度优先搜索，而在大多数人 20 多岁时，他们需要的是广度优先搜索。

你可以在 20 多岁时，做一些你之前，之后都无法做好的事情，比如一时冲动地投入一个项目，或者没有截止时间地旅行。如果你在 20 多岁时成功创业了，那么你便与这些事情再也无缘了。

## 尝试

Should you do it at any age? I realize I've made startups sound pretty hard. If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup is really hard. What if it's too hard? How can you tell if you're up to this challenge?

The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell. Your life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football player. But unless you've had a very strange life you haven't done much that was like being a startup founder. Starting a startup will change you a lot. So what you're trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?

For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would have what it took to start successful startups. It was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over that threshold. The hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become. There may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that, so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the answer is: not much. I learned to keep a completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.

The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure they will ace Y Combinator just as they've aced every one of the (few, artificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far. Others arrive wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever mistake caused it to accept them. But there is little correlation between founders' initial attitudes and how well their companies do.

I've read that the same is true in the military — that the swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous lives.

If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.

Ideas

So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college? There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders. And the m.o. for getting both is the same. Which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.

I've written a whole essay on this, so I won't repeat it all here. But the short version is that if you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're bad.

The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.

This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all got started. None of these companies were even meant to be companies at first. They were all just side projects. The best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.

Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously? (1) Learn a lot about things that matter, then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you like and respect. The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.

The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of "learn a lot about things that matter," I wrote "become good at some technology." But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow. What was special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were experts in technology. They were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making projects happen. So you don't have to work on technology per se, so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.

What kind of problems are those? That is very hard to answer in the general case. History is full of examples of young people who were working on important problems that no one else at the time thought were important, and in particular that their parents didn't think were important. On the other hand, history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their kids were wasting their time and who were right. So how do you know when you're working on real stuff? [8]

I know how I know. Real problems are interesting, and I am self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make myself work on boring things, even if they're supposed to be important.

My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just because it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful in some worldly way. Y Combinator itself was something I only did because it seemed interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that helps me out. But I don't know what other people have in their heads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup. And indeed, probably also the best way to live. [9]

But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them. If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents an interesting problem. So one guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul Buchheit put it, to "live in the future." When you reach that point, ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem obvious to you. You may not realize they're startup ideas, but you'll know they're something that ought to exist.

For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software. He didn't mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it into one. He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on networks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did any more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this is exactly the way the best startups get started.

So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational version of college focused on "entrepreneurship." It's the classic version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things. And if you have genuine intellectual curiosity, that's what you'll naturally tend to do if you just follow your own inclinations. [10]

The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.

At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process.

So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders, boiled down to two words: just learn.
