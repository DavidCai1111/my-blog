理论上，专利是一笔可以阻断竞争和产生授权收入的无形资产。可现实中，大多数的专利持有者并不实施自己的专利，或者缺乏使之成为产品的金融资源。这种情况下，由于专利年费，专利往往成了他们的一项负债，而不是资产。不过好消息是，专利货币化的市场如今越来越好，愿意买入专利来进行生产或授权的买家越来越多。

如果把卖专利想象成卖房子，那么你可能就想错了。它们之间还是有不少差别。大多数的房子最终都会在一个正确的价格成交，但许多专利却不会。为什么？一个专利本质上是一个授予权利人排他生产权利的无形资产。因此，将专利卖出即等于给与了买家这种发明的排他生产权。这意味着，如果这个发明在行业里没有其他人有能力生产，那么这个「排他权」在当下就是没有价值的。并且，专利的质量众所周知十分不稳定，不少研究表示，超过一半的专利，如果有人尝试宣告其无效，那么它们都会无效。最后，卖专利这件事，对买卖双方的技术，法律和商业经验都有很高的要求。因此，在买卖的过程的早起，就委托专利买卖中间人进行交易是有价值的。

## 在接触中间人之前

在接触中介之前，强烈建议不要直接去与买家或当前的侵权者接触。现实中，大多数专利买家不会对个人卖家的小数量专利有很大兴趣，这会损害卖家在那里的第一印象。另外，卖家对专利价值不切实际的评估，亦可能影响他们在后期谈判中的信用。此外，如果过早把专利给与潜在的侵权者，那么他们可能就会尝试对专利进行无效宣告。这可能会对卖家产生一笔额外的法律费用。

## 如何选择一个中间人

一个专利中介者提供的服务有：资产分析，准备销售策略，联系潜在买家，并且在过户之前提供各类法律帮助。在目前的市场中，大多数中间人代表卖家，仅在一些细分领域中，中间人会代表买家（通常是匿名进行的）。尽管有些中间人会代表双方，但是由于双方的利益冲突，这种方式通常不会有好的预期结果。

目前，专利经济人行业并没有很好的监管，所以任何人都可以称自己为专利中间人。这种现状让人们区分好公司和坏公司变得法曼。所以在接触一个中间人时，有下列注意事项：

首先，询问他们的买卖记录。有很多个人中间人，他们声称可以帮助卖专利，但是事实上他们一件专利买卖的经验都没有。所以你必须要去索取他们最近的买卖记录与其真实存在的证据。第二，印象买卖成功率的重要因素就是与中间人合作的买家的数量。由于专利买卖很大程度上是由中间人的人际关系驱动的，所以总是先询问下中间人的买家网络情况。第三，询问在中间人的团队里，是否有技术专家和法律专家，这会直接影响对于专利价值的理解以及向潜在买家传递的材料的质量。专利持有人应当索取一份最近专利转移中有代表性的材料的样例（比如，执行摘要，索赔图表），来判断中间人的水平。很多小型中间人会将项目外包，例如以低价将法律服务外包给小公司。不幸的是，这种情况下，由于执行工作的人，不是专业的拥有专利代理经验的人，工作的结果往往差强人意。这就是优秀的中介公司闪耀的地方，他们任命一流的技术专家并准备高质量的法律文件，而业余爱好者却只会向买家发送包含专利号的简介视频。记住，只有当专利以最佳的形式呈现在买家面前时，成交的可能性与金额才会最令人满意。

Broker compensation models
Once the patent holder has selected a brokerage firm, the parties will generally enter into a formal agreement detailing the parameters of their relationship. Most brokerage agreements resemble one another in that they require an exclusive representation (for the same reason that you would not appoint several realtors simultaneously to sell your house on the market), some collaboration requirements, details as to compensation, a term and a certain ‘tail’ to ensure that efforts made during the term are compensated should a transaction with a prospect contacted through your broker occur within a certain timeframe after the representation has ended.

Patent brokers have different business models. Generally, the industry is based largely on a success fee, varying from between 20% and 35% of the transaction value, with variation depending on the size of the portfolio, the work required to bring the patents to market and whether a retainer fee is paid upfront. Although this seems high compared to, for example, the real estate market, the patent marketplace is still very illiquid and many patents will never sell regardless of price and marketing effort. Therefore, a higher risk/reward model prevails. Ultimately, it is virtually impossible to sell patents without professional help. Good brokers will more than make up for their success fees with their ability to generate offers and negotiate a better price for clients. The interests of the patent holder and the broker are largely aligned, as the broker is incentivised to bring a transaction to close at the highest price possible. A retainer fee will never adequately compensate for the investment in time and money required to prepare a portfolio for a sale and negotiate a successful transaction.

Different types of buyer
Entities which buy patents generally fall within two broad categories:

operating companies; and
non-practising entities (NPEs).
Operating companies may have strong patent portfolios themselves and look at third-party assets strategically either to complement their own assets or as a litigation avoidance measure when they are possibly infringing. They rarely buy to monetise, which means that they have more price flexibility (and deeper pockets) than most NPEs. They are also more secretive about the sale process and transactions, more concerned about licence grant-backs and generally take longer to close a deal, as buying patents is not their core business.

The main business activity of NPEs is to hold patents. They come in various flavours. Large aggregators buy to create licensing programmes. Defensive patent funds buy patents to license their own members to circumvent assertion of these patents. More aggressive patent assertion entities (referred to as ‘patent trolls’) aim to monetise the patents through licensing and litigation. Finally, some long-term-oriented IP funds and a few sovereign IP funds selectively acquire patents using public funds to protect a particular national industry.

All buyers have their own motivations for acquiring patents and some companies have been known to buy patents in areas that were not directly related to their sphere of activities. In addition, whereas operating companies will generally pay for patents in an all-cash sale, NPEs are more flexible and some will offer (and often prefer) a hybrid model where some of the risks are shared with the seller on the back end.

What makes a patent sell
Many factors may affect a patent portfolio’s valuation and likelihood of attracting offers, including the number of assets in the family (single patents are harder to sell), the priority dates, the overall quality of drafting of both the specification and claims, the prosecution history and the number of backward and forward citations. However, in our experience of selling more than 2,000 patents, one factor trumps them all: is the patent infringed? If no one practises a patent, an operating company has little incentive to pay for something that it does not really need and most NPEs will not acquire patents that they cannot monetise in the short term. Thus, detecting and documenting infringement is paramount, and a seller can really help its own cause by monitoring what is going on in the industry to which the patent relates and pointing out potentially infringing activities to the broker.

What is a patent worth?
One of the most difficult tasks when selling patents is to fix realistic pricing guidance for any given portfolio. This is largely because – unlike in the real estate market – the vast majority of patent transactions are not reported publicly, thus offering few comparable sales. Further, each patent is unique and even the same patent may fluctuate significantly in value depending on whether it is infringed (and by whom), or whether relevant prior art is found that casts a shadow on its validity. Patent owners also tend to get confused between the valuation in a sale, where the acquirer buys on a discounted cash-flow value as it takes on all of the risk and expenses of maintaining and enforcing the assets (which can run in millions of dollars), and that in a licensing programme, where all of these risks and expenses remain with the existing patent owner. A competent broker will look at all surrounding circumstances and offer the portfolio with a pricing guidance that properly reflects the value of the assets without deterring prospects from presenting offers. As a quick rule of thumb, and based on transactions that have been reported publicly, the average price per patent in 2014 is around $200,000, with significant variation of both sides of this average. This still represents a healthy return on the investment required to acquire and maintain the assets.

Patent sale process
When it comes to the process itself, selling patents is similar to selling a house. Once the broker has analysed the portfolio and prepared all the materials to support a sale, it will reach out to prospective buyers and let them know that the patents are for sale, along with details of any infringement, encumbrances and pricing guidance. To the extent that some of the prospects being contacted are potential infringers, the broker should normally prepare redacted materials stripping any specifics that would otherwise put the prospect ‘on notice’. From then on, it may take several weeks before the broker hears back from anyone, as most companies buying patents are inundated with similar solicitations. This is an area where the network and reputation of the broker really make a difference in attracting proper attention to the patents on offer. Still, it is likely that many people will not respond even if they have thoroughly reviewed the patents and decided to pass. Others may require a non-disclosure agreement before reviewing in more details and/or making an offer.

If the broker specifies a deadline for the submission of offers, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months before a formal offer is made and, in many cases, there will not be one. A competent broker should be able to navigate through the process seamlessly, whether there are multiple offers or only one. If there is no interest in the portfolio, it is important to understand the causes and revise the strategy accordingly. At all times the broker should keep the seller informed about the status of the sale.

Closing the deal
Once an agreement on price has been reached with a buyer, the next step consists of entering into a formal patent purchase agreement (PPA) to memorialise the sale. This is where the licence grant-back to the seller (if any) will be stated. While these contracts tend to be relatively standard, they contain a myriad of legal and technical details that will require close attention and professional advice. Therefore, while the broker can provide guidance regarding certain provisions in the proposed PPA, the seller is strongly advised to seek independent legal review.

In parallel to executing a PPA, the buyer will require that any missing or incomplete documents be filed or perfected. This is the equivalent to satisfying the ‘punch list’ of a house inspection before the transaction can go through. While many buyers will conduct most of their due diligence before making an offer, some others (mostly NPEs) will take that step only after the parties have already reached an agreement on price or have signed the PPA.

Once the PPA has been signed and all items on the punch list have been satisfied, the buyer will be ready to disburse the funds in exchange for receiving the original patent assignment that officially transfers title. The closing process can take from a few weeks to several months, depending on the complexity of the deal, the number of outstanding items and the velocity of both parties in moving the process forward. Many things can derail a deal during that period and a seller should not attempt to close such a complex transaction without proper representation.
